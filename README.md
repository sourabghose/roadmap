# 9-Month Career Roadmap: From Data Analyst to ML/AI Engineer

This is an interactive web application that serves as a detailed and self-paced roadmap for anyone looking to transition into a career in data science and AI. The application breaks down the 9-month journey into three key phases, with a month-by-month curriculum of specific topics, projects, and resources.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive and actionable guide. Key features of the application include:

- Interactive Roadmap: A visual representation of the career path, structured into three major phases: Data Analyst Foundations, Data Scientist Transition, and ML/AI Engineer Transition.
- Detailed Curriculum: Each month contains a checklist of specific topics, allowing for micro-learning and progress tracking.
- Progress Tracking: The checklist state is automatically saved to the browser's local storage, so users can keep a personal record of their learning journey.
- Key Resources: Each month is supplemented with a list of recommended resources to guide learning.
- Responsive Design: The application is built to be fully functional and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: For the core structure of the web application.
- Tailwind CSS: For a clean, responsive, and modern UI/UX design.
- Chart.js: To create an interactive donut chart that visualizes the time allocation for each phase of the roadmap.
- Vanilla JavaScript: To handle all interactive elements, including phase navigation, expanding/collapsing monthly details, and managing the progress checklist via local storage.
